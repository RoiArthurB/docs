# Control device

Scrcpy supports various input events, including mouse, touch, keyboard, and physical buttons. The client sends input events to the server, which injects them into the device.

There are three ways to create or send control messages, they provide the same set of methods:

- [Touch event](./touch.mdx)
- [Keyboard event](./keyboard.mdx)
- [Text input](./text.mdx)
- [Rotate device](./rotate.mdx)

## Using `@yume-chan/scrcpy`

### Using `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`

The `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer` class provides methods to serialize events into Scrcpy messages. It's up to the caller to send the serialized message to the server.

The message format differs between Scrcpy versions, so a `ScrcpyOptionsX_YY` instance is required when creating the serializer.

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_21({});
const serializer = new ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer(options);
const message: Uint8Array = serializer.rotateDevice();
```

### Using `ScrcpyControlMessageWriter`

`ScrcpyControlMessageWriter` class connects a `WritableStream<Uint8Array>` to a `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`. It writes serialized messages to the stream.

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyControlMessageWriter } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";
import { WritableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const stream = new WritableStream<Uint8Array>();
const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_21({});
const writer = new ScrcpyControlMessageWriter(stream.getWriter(), options);

await writer.rotateDevice();
```

It has the same set of methods as `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`, plus a `write` method to write arbitrary data to the stream.

```ts transpile
await writer.write(new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]));
```

Make sure to write the whole message at once, otherwise it might be interleaved with other messages.

## Using `@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy`

When control is not disabled (`control: false` not exist in options), `AdbScrcpyClient.controller` is a `ScrcpyControlMessageWriter` that connects to the server's control socket.

```ts transpile
if (client.controller) {
  await client.controller.rotateDevice();
}
```

`AdbScrcpyClient` also hooks up the device message socket to the options object, so `setClipboard` method can be used directly.
