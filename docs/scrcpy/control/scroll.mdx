# Mouse scroll event

Inject a mouse scroll event into the device.

Mouse scroll event simulate a physical mouse wheel. It doesn't simulate a finger swipe gesture.

Most apps will respond to mouse scroll events and scroll the content accordingly, but some apps (like games) may not support it or have incorrect scrolling speed.

## Options

```ts
interface ScrcpyInjectScrollControlMessage {
  pointerX: number;
  pointerY: number;
  screenWidth: number;
  screenHeight: number;
  scrollX: number;
  scrollY: number;
  buttons: number;
}
```

- `pointerX`: The X coordinate of the event.
- `pointerY`: The Y coordinate of the event.
- `screenWidth`: The width of the screen. It must match the current video stream resolution to prevent de-synchronization.
- `screenHeight`: The height of the screen. It must match the current video stream resolution to prevent de-synchronization.
- `scrollX`: The horizontal scroll amount. Positive values scroll left, negative values scroll right.
- `scrollY`: The vertical scroll amount. Positive values scroll up, negative values scroll down.
- `buttons`: The state of all the buttons. It's a bit-or combination of `AndroidMotionEventButton` values.

`scrollX` and `scrollY` is in ticks, the result pixel is determined by system settings and app implementation. Fractional values are allowed to simulate high-precision scroll.

## Changelog

### v1.15

- `scrollX` and `scrollY` only accepts integer values. Options classes before `ScrcpyOptions1_25` will accumulate fractional values and only send integer values to the server.
- `buttons` is not supported and will be ignored.

### v1.22

- Support for `buttons` field is added.

### v1.25

- Support for fractional values in `scrollX` and `scrollY` is added.

## Usage

```ts transpile
// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`
const message: Uint8Array = serializer.injectScroll({
  pointerX: 100,
  pointerY: 200,
  screenWidth: 1920,
  screenHeight: 1080,
  scrollX: 0,
  scrollY: -1,
  buttons: 0,
});


// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageWriter`
await writer.injectScroll({
  pointerX: 100,
  pointerY: 200,
  screenWidth: 1920,
  screenHeight: 1080,
  scrollX: 0,
  scrollY: -1,
  buttons: 0,
});

// Using `AdbScrcpyClient`
await client.controller!.injectScroll({
  pointerX: 100,
  pointerY: 200,
  screenWidth: 1920,
  screenHeight: 1080,
  scrollX: 0,
  scrollY: -1,
  buttons: 0,
});
```
