# Create options

Scrcpy protocol changes over time, and are usually not backward compatible. In Tango's implementation, the options actually have two proposals:

* It defines which server options are available
* It normalize the behavior between different server versions

It's important to use the correct options class for the server version you're using. Using an incorrect version almost always results in a error.
