# Create options

Scrcpy protocol changes over time, and are usually not backward compatible. In Tango's implementation, the options actually have two proposes:

- It defines which server options are available
- It normalize the behavior between different server versions

It's important to use the correct options class for the server version you're using. Using an incorrect version almost always results in a error.

## With `@yume-chan/scrcpy`

Each time a new option is added to the server, or a breaking change is made, a new options class is created. The class name is `ScrcpyOptionsX_XX`, where `X` is the major version and `XX` is the minor version. For example, `ScrcpyOptions2_1` is the options class for server version 2.1.

Some Scrcpy versions contain only bug fixes or client-side changes, so they don't have a corresponding options class. In this case, you can use the options class of the previous version.

All options classes take an object for server options:

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions2_2 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions2_2({
    videoSource: "camera",
});
```

Check the TypeScript definition files for available server options in each version. All server options are optional. The default value can be found in `ScrcpyOptionsX_XX.DEFAULTS` or `options.defaults` fields.

## With `@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy`

`@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy` needs to do some additional behavior normalizations, so it has its own options classes. The naming convention is the same as `@yume-chan/scrcpy`, but with a `Adb` prefix. For example, `AdbScrcpyOptions2_1` is the options class for server version 2.1.

It's more rare for protocol changes to affect `AdbScrcpyOptionsX_XX`, thus there are fewer `AdbScrcpyOptionsX_XX` classes than `ScrcpyOptionsX_XX` classes, and the versions in them are not always the same.

`AdbScrcpyOptionsX_XX` wraps a `ScrcpyOptionsX_XX` instance, and provides additional methods to interact with the device:

```ts transpile
import { AdbScrcpyOptions2_1 } from "@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy";
import { ScrcpyOptions2_2 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new AdbScrcpyOptions2_1(
    new ScrcpyOptions2_2({
        videoSource: "camera",
    })
);
```

## Versions

Check the [versions](./versions.mdx) page to see which options class to use for each server version.
