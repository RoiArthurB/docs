# Quick Start

[Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) is an open-source tool to mirror Android screen to desktop, and control it from desktop. It has two parts:

* A client written in C: It uses SDL for cross-platform display and input, and FFMpeg for video encoding.
* A server written in Java: It runs on Android devices, and uses Android system APIs to capture screen and inject input events. The server is started by client using ADB, thus having much more privileges than regular apps.

Tango provides a TypeScript implementation of the client API, so that it can run in browsers and Node.js. It's fully compatible with the original Scrcpy server, so latest features and bug fixes are available immediately. It doesn't provide any UI components, so you need to create your own UI.

## Standalone Usage

The core library `@yume-chan/scrcpy` provides low-level APIs to serialize and deserialize Scrcpy protocol messages. It doesn't use any Web or Node.js APIs, so it can be used in any JavaScript environment.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @yume-chan/scrcpy
```

It can be used standalone if you can communicate with Scrcpy server using other means.

## Use with Tango

The `@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy` package combines `@yume-chan/scrcpy` with `@yume-chan/adb` to provides high-level APIs to start the server, establish the connection, and control the device. It also doesn't use any Web or Node.js APIs, nor providing any UI components.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @yume-chan/scrcpy @yume-chan/adb-scrcpy
```
