# Prepare Server

Scrcpy server is a Java application that runs on Android devices. Tango uses the unmodified, official Scrcpy server binary, so you don't need to build it yourself.

Tango doesn't include the server binary in the package, so the first step is to download the server binary.

The server binary is subject to [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Download from official releases

You can download the official server binary from [Scrcpy GitHub releases](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases) and copy into your project.

### Import the server binary

Depends on your runtime, bundler and framework, you may need to consume `server.bin` differently.

For frontend meta frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, Solid Start, etc.), usually there are two ways to include a binary file:

1. Put it in `public` folder, and reference it using a fixed URL (e.g. `https://your-domain.com/server.bin`)
2. Import it in a JavaScript source file and let the bundler handle it

We recommend the second approach, because it's more flexible, less error-prone, and has better cache control.

Assume you have downloaded the server binary to `src/server.bin`, and you want to embed it into your app:

<Tabs className="runtime-tabs" groupId="bundler">
    <TabItem label="Webpack 5" value="webpack-5">

```ts transpile
const url = new URL("./server.bin", import.meta.url);
const server: ArrayBuffer = await fetch(url).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer());
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Vite" value="vite">

```ts transpile
const url = new URL("./server.bin", import.meta.url);
const server: ArrayBuffer = await fetch(url).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer());
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Node.js" value="node">

```ts transpile
import fs from "fs/promises";

const url = new URL("./server.bin", import.meta.url);
const server: Buffer = await fs.readFile(url);
```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Use `@yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server`

`@yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server` package provides a script to download the server binary and save the version string automatically.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server
```

Usage:

```sh
npx fetch-scrcpy-server <version>
```

For example:

```sh
npx fetch-scrcpy-server 2.1
```

:::info[Note for Scrcpy 2.2]

Usually the version number is `[major].[minor].[revision]`, but for Scrcpy 2.2, due to a packaging error (from Scrcpy side), the server expects the version number to be `v2.2` (with a `v` prefixed).

To download Scrcpy 2.2 server, use:

```sh
npx fetch-scrcpy-server v2.2
```

:::

The server binary is written to `server.bin` and the version is written to `version.js` in this package's root (usually in your `node_modules`).

Importing this package will give you two variables:

- `BIN`: A URL to the server binary. It can be used in `fetch` or `fs.readFile` similar to the manual approach.
- `VERSION`: A string containing the downloaded server version. It's required when starting the server.

<Tabs className="runtime-tabs" groupId="bundler">
    <TabItem label="Webpack 5" value="webpack-5">

```ts transpile
import { BIN, VERSION } from "@yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server";

console.log(VERSION); // 2.1
const server: ArrayBuffer = await fetch(BIN).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer());
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Vite" value="vite">

```ts transpile
import { BIN, VERSION } from "@yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server";

console.log(VERSION); // 2.1
const server: ArrayBuffer = await fetch(BIN).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer());
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Node.js" value="node">

```ts transpile
import fs from "fs/promises";
import { BIN, VERSION } from "@yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server";

console.log(VERSION); // 2.1
const server: Buffer = await fs.readFile(BIN);
```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Run the script automatically

After installing the package, you can add it to your `package.json`, so every time you run `npm install`, the script will be executed automatically.

```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server": "^0.0.24"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "fetch-scrcpy-server 2.1"
  }
}
```

## Build the server

You can also build the server binary yourself. This is useful if you want to modify the server, or if you want to use the latest version from Scrcpy Git repository.

The easiest way is to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

1. Clone Scrcpy

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy.git
   ```

2. Open the root folder in Android Studio
3. (Optional) Change `Build Variant` to `release` from `Build` -> `Select Build Variant` menu item
4. Select `Build` -> `Make Project` menu item

The server binary will be written to `server/build/outputs/apk/debug/server-debug.apk` (`debug` variant) or `server/build/outputs/apk/release/server-release-unsigned.apk` (`release` variant).

:::note

Check [Scrcpy documentation](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/doc/build.md) for more details on building both the client and server.
