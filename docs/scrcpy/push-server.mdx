# Push server file

The server file needs to be copied to the device and executed on it. It will listen on a UNIX domain socket and wait for connections from the client.

The default path of the server file on device is `/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar`. Before version 2.3, the path of Scrcpy server binary is hard-coded in the server itself. So you must push it to this exact path, otherwise the clean up steps won't delete the server file.

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

```bash
adb push scrcpy-server.jar /data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar
```

## Using `pushServer`

`@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy` package provides a `pushServer` function as a shortcut for the Tango [`AdbSync#write`](../tango/commands/sync/write.md) call.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { AdbScrcpyClient } from "@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const server: ArrayBuffer;

await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(new Consumable(new Uint8Array(server)));
      controller.close();
    },
  }),
);
```

By default, it pushes to `/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar`. You can specify a different path by passing the third argument.

```ts transpile
await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(new Consumable(new Uint8Array(server)));
      controller.close();
    },
  }),
  "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar",
);
```

If the server binary is downloaded using `fetch`, it's also possible to use the response stream directly. In theory, this is more efficient because the downloading and pushing is run in parallel. However, in practice, because how small the server binary is, it doesn't make much difference. If the cache is not properly configured, this will download the server binary every time, so it might be even slower.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import {
  WrapReadableStream,
  WrapConsumableStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const url: URL;

const response = await fetch(url);

await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  new WrapReadableStream(response.body).pipeThrough(new WrapConsumableStream()),
);
```

## Using `AdbSync#write`

The above code is a shortcut for the following code:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const server: ArrayBuffer;

const sync = await adb.sync();
try {
  await sync.write({
    filename: "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar",
    file: new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        controller.enqueue(new Consumable(new Uint8Array(server)));
        controller.close();
      },
    }),
  });
} finally {
  await sync.dispose();
}
```

Or using `fetch`:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import {
  WrapReadableStream,
  WrapConsumableStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const url: URL;

const response = await fetch(url);

const sync = await adb.sync();
try {
  await sync.write({
    filename: "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar",
    file: new WrapReadableStream(response.body).pipeThrough(
      new WrapConsumableStream(),
    ),
  });
} finally {
  await sync.dispose();
}
```
