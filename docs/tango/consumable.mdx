# Consumable pattern

Web Streams API doesn't provide a way to track where the data is, for example:

```ts
const readable = new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));
    controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array([4, 5, 6]));
    controller.close();
  },
});

const transform = new TransformStream({
  transform(chunk, controller) {
    console.log("transform", chunk);
    controller.enqueue(chunk);
  },
});

const writable = new WritableStream({
  write(chunk) {
    console.log("write", chunk);
  },
});

await readable.pipeThrough(transform).pipeTo(writable);
```

In `readable`, `controller.enqueue` is a synchronous operation, the data source can't know where the data is going and when it's finally consumed.

`readable` can't enqueuing the same `Uint8Array` with modified content multiple times, which reduces memory allocation and GC overheads (so better performance), because `readable` can't know when the buffer is consumed and it's safe to modify it.

## `Consumable<T>`

The `Consumable` class is a wrapper around a value of type `T`. It allows the consumer to tell the producer when the value is no longer needed.

```ts
import { Consumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

function useData(data: Consumable<Uint8Array>) {
  console.log(data.value); // use the value
  data.consume();
}

async function produceData() {
  const data = new Consumable(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));
  useData(data);
  await data.consumed;
}
```

Let's use the `Consumable` pattern to re-write the previous example:

```ts
import {
  Consumable,
  ReadableStream,
  TransformStream,
  WritableStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const buffer = new Uint8Array(3);

new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    buffer[0] = 1;
    buffer[1] = 2;
    buffer[2] = 3;

    // highlight-start
    const consumable1 = new Consumable(buffer);
    controller.enqueue(consumable1);
    await consumable1.consumed;
    // highlight-end

    buffer[0] = 4;
    buffer[1] = 5;
    buffer[2] = 6;

    // highlight-start
    const consumable2 = new Consumable(buffer);
    controller.enqueue(consumable2);
    await consumable2.consumed;
    // highlight-end

    controller.close();
  },
})
  .pipeThrough(
    new TransformStream({
      transform(chunk, controller) {
        console.log(chunk.value);
        controller.enqueue(chunk);
      },
    })
  )
  .pipeTo(
    new WritableStream({
      write(chunk) {
        console.log(chunk.value);
        chunk.consume();
      },
    })
  );
```

Here, we create a `Consumable` for each `enqueue` operation, and `await` for the `consumed` promise to be settled before modifying the buffer.

It doesn't completely eliminate allocations, but a `Uint8Array` can be much larger than a `Consumable`, so it's still beneficial.

## `tryConsume`

`Consumable#tryConsume` method is a helper method to consume the value by calling a callback:

```ts
import { Consumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

function useData(data: Consumable<Uint8Array>) {
  data.tryConsume((value) => {
    console.log(value);
  });
}
```

`tryConsume` invokes the callback immediately with the inner value, and mark the `Consumable` as consumed when the callback completes (returns or throws). If the callback returns a `Promise`, `tryConsume` will wait for the `Promise` to be settled.

### Improve debugging experience

Normally, when piping data around streams, Chrome DevTools doesn't track the data flow, so the call stack is always empty:

```ts
import { ReadableStream, WritableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));
    controller.close();
  },
}).pipeTo(
  new WritableStream({
    write(chunk) {
      // highlight-start
      debugger; // Here the call stack is empty: it doesn't tell you where the `chunk` comes from
      // highlight-end
    },
  })
);
```

With `tryConsume`, `Consumable` will synthesis a call stack using [`console.createTask`](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/devtools-modern-web-debugging/):

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  Consumable,
  ReadableStream,
  WritableStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue(new Consumable(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])));
    controller.close();
  },
}).pipeTo(
  new WritableStream({
    write(chunk) {
      // highlight-start
      chunk.tryConsume((value) => {
        debugger; // The call stack will point to line 9 (`new Consumable(...)`)
      });
      // highlight-end
    },
  })
);
```

## `MaybeConsumable<T>`

Most streams are actually accepting `MaybeConsumable<T>`, which means they can accept both `T` and `Consumable<T>`:

```ts
import {
  Consumable,
  WritableStream,
  MaybeConsumable,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const stream: WritableStream<MaybeConsumable<Uint8Array>>;

const writer = stream.getWriter();
// highlight-start
await writer.write(new Consumable(new Uint8Array([4, 5, 6]))); // works
await writer.write(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])); // also works
// highlight-end
```

This allows a blob stream to be directly piped into a `WritableStream`:

```ts
declare const blob: File | Blob;

blob.stream().pipeTo(writable);
```

You can choose to use `Consumable<T>` when either:

- You need to re-use the buffer, so you want to track when it's consumed.
- You want to improve debugging experience by synthesizing a call stack.

### `tryConsume`

`MaybeConsumable` namespace also provides a helper method `tryConsume`. It's a static method so it accepts both `T` and `Consumable<T>`.

```ts
import { MaybeConsumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

MaybeConsumable.tryConsume(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]), (value) => {
  console.log(value); // Uint8Array [1, 2, 3]
});

MaybeConsumable.tryConsume(
  new Consumable(new Uint8Array([4, 5, 6])),
  (value) => {
    console.log(value); // Uint8Array [4, 5, 6]
  }
);
```

If the `value` is a `Consumable`, it behaves the same as [`Consumable#tryConsume`](#tryconsume). If it's not, it just invokes the callback immediately with the value.
