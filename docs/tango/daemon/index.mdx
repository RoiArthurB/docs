In Direct Connection Mode, Tango connects to the ADB daemon running on Android devices directly. This is the lowest-level connection mode, Tango controls all the steps, including authentication, message encoding and decoding, and connection management.

The `AdbDaemonTransport` class from `@yume-chan/adb` implements this mode.

To support different runtime and connection method, `AdbDaemonTransport` accepts an `AdbDaemonConnection` object for communicating with the device, and an `AdbCredentialStore` object for managing client certificates.

Here are the overall steps to create a direct connection:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant T as AdbDaemonTransport

    create participant Conn as AdbDaemonConnection
    C->>Conn: Create

    create participant Cred as AdbCredentialStore
    C->>Cred: Create

    C->>+T: Start handshake

    T->>+Conn: Send handshake
    Conn->>T: Return authentication parameters

    T->>+Cred: Get or create client certificate
    Cred->>-T: Return client certificate

    T->>Conn: Send authentication packets
    Conn->>-T: Return authentication result

    T->>-C: Return authenticated connection
    C->>C: Create Adb instance
```

There are two built-in `AdbDaemonConnection` implementations, and you can also create other custom connections to meet your requirements.

## USB Connection

USB connection is the most common way to connect to Android devices.

[`@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb) package provides an `AdbDaemonConnection` using [WebUSB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebUSB_API). It can use varies WebUSB compatible implementations, including the native implementation in Web browsers, and the [`usb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usb) package in Node.js.

## TCP Connection

ADB over Wi-Fi (a.k.a TCP/IP mode) allows you to connect to Android devices without a USB cable. It can also connect to Google Android Emulators running on the same machine.

There is no Web API for TCP connection, so it's not available in Web browsers. In Node.js, it can be implemented using the built-in `net` module.

## Custom Connection

In addition to the built-in connection methods, Tango also accepts custom connection implementations. For example, a WebSocket connection can forward TCP connections from a Node.js server to a Web browser.
