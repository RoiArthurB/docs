**Daemon Transport** connects to ADB daemons directly. This is the lowest-level transport, it controls all the steps, including authentication, message encoding and decoding, and connection management.

This transport is implemented by the `AdbDaemonTransport` class from `@yume-chan/adb` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @yume-chan/adb
```

To support different runtime and connection method, `AdbDaemonTransport` class itself only defines how to serialize and deserialize ADB packets. An `AdbDaemonConnection` implementation is required to send and receive those packets, and an `AdbCredentialStore` implementation is required to manage client certificates.

Here are the overall steps to create a Daemon Transport:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant T as AdbDaemonTransport

    create participant Conn as AdbDaemonConnection
    C->>Conn: Create

    create participant Cred as AdbCredentialStore
    C->>Cred: Create

    C->>+T: Start handshake

    T->>+Conn: Send handshake
    Conn->>T: Return authentication parameters

    T->>+Cred: Get or create client certificate
    Cred->>-T: Return client certificate

    T->>Conn: Send authentication packets
    Conn->>-T: Return authentication result

    T->>-C: Return authenticated connection
    C->>C: Create Adb instance
```

Tango provides two built-in `AdbDaemonConnection` implementations, and you can also create other custom connections to meet your requirements.

## USB Connection

USB connection is the oldest and most common way to connect to Android devices.

[`@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb) package provides an `AdbDaemonConnection` implementation based on [WebUSB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebUSB_API). It can use varies WebUSB compatible implementations, including the native implementation in Web browsers, and the [`usb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usb) package in Node.js.

## TCP Connection

ADB over Wi-Fi (a.k.a TCP/IP mode) allows you to connect to Android devices without a USB cable. It can also connect to Google Android Emulators running on the same machine.

There is no Web API for TCP connection, so it's not available on Web platforms. In Node.js, it can be implemented using the built-in `net` module.

## Custom Connection

In addition to the built-in connection methods, Tango also accepts custom connection implementations. For example, a WebSocket connection can forward TCP connections from a Node.js server to a Web browser.
