# Direct Connection

In Direct Connection Mode, Tango connects to the ADB daemon running on Android devices directly. This is the lowest-level connection mode, Tango controls all the steps, including authentication, message encoding and decoding, and connection management.

The `AdbDaemonTransport` class from `@yume-chan/adb` implements this mode.

To support different runtime and connection method, `AdbDaemonTransport` accepts an `AdbDaemonConnection` object for communicating with the device, and an `AdbCredentialStore` object for managing client certificates.

Here are the basic steps to establish a connection in Direct Connection Mode:

1. Create an `AdbDaemonConnection` object for the runtime and connection method you want to use.
2. Create an `AdnCredentialStore` object for the runtime.
3. Pass the connection and credential store to `AdbDaemonTransport` to authenticate and initialize the connection.
4. Use the `AdbDaemonTransport` object to create an `Adb` instance.
5. Use the `Adb` instance to send commands to the device.
