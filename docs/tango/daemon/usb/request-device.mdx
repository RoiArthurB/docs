## Request permission in WebUSB

In Web browsers, each website needs to request the permission to access each device separately using WebUSB's [`USB#requestDevice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB/requestDevice) method.

`USB#requestDevice` method requires [user activation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation), which means it can only be called in response to a mouse click or keyboard press event.

After calling `USB#requestDevice`, the browser shows a list of connected devices to the user. The user can select one (and only one) device from the list, or cancel the picker without selecting any device.

It will return an `USBDevice` instance representing the selected device, or throws an `DOMException` with `name` set to `NotFoundError` if the user cancelled the picker.

```ts transpile
document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  try {
    // highlight-start
    const device: USBDevice = await navigator.usb.requestDevice({
      filters: [
        {
          classCode: 0xff,
          subclassCode: 0x42,
          protocolCode: 1,
        },
      ],
    });
    // highlight-end
    alert(`Selected device: ${device.serialNumber}`);
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof DOMException && e.name === "NotFoundError") {
      alert("No device selected");
      return;
    }

    throw e;
  }
});
```

The permission will be persisted by the browser, so from next time, the website can access that device without calling `requestDevice` again. The user can revoke the permission in "Settings -> Site Permissions -> USB devices" at any time.

### Android USB mode affects permissions

In USB specification, one device can have multiple **interfaces**. Each interface represents a self-contained feature. For example, a USB headset can have one interface for audio input and one interface for audio output.

One device can also have multiple **configurations**. Each configuration is a set of interfaces. It can turn on or off some features by switching between configurations.

Android devices have multiple interfaces, like MTP mode for file transfer, ADB mode for debugging, and so on. And each interface can be turned on or off in its system UI. However, Android devices doesn't use multiple USB configurations.

This might partially because Windows doesn't support switching USB configurations unless a custom driver is installed. So, when switching USB modes, Android devices will disconnect and reconnect to the computer, and tell the computer that it's a different device with different interfaces.

:::note

In contrast, Apple mobile devices (iPods, iPhones and iPads) use multiple USB configurations. In the default configuration, they only have one interface for transferring files using MTP, Only when iTunes and its special driver is installed, they can switch to another configuration with an extra interface for syncing with iTunes.

:::

As a result, in Web browsers, each USB modes of an Android device has separate permissions. After switching to a new USB mode, the website needs to request permission again.

## Request permission in Tango

Tango represents each device as an `AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice` instance, which includes the `USBDevice` instance and some additional information.

You can manually construct an `AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice` instance from a `USBDevice` instance, but it's easier to use the `AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager#requestDevice` method that does it for you.

```ts
declare class AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager {
  requestDevice(): Promise<AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice | undefined>;
}
```

Same as `USB#requestDevice`, it requires user activation. However, it returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error if the user cancelled the picker.

```ts transpile
import { AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice } from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";

document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  // highlight-start
  const device: AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice | undefined =
    await Manager.requestDevice();
  // highlight-end
  if (!device) {
    alert("No device selected");
    return;
  }
});
```

## Filter devices in the picker

```ts
interface AdbDeviceFilter {
  classCode: number;
  subclassCode: number;
  protocolCode: number;
  vendorId?: number | undefined;
  productId?: number | undefined;
  serialNumber?: string | undefined;
}

namespace AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager {
  interface RequestDeviceOptions {
    filters?: AdbDeviceFilter[] | undefined;
    exclusionFilters?: USBDeviceFilter[] | undefined;
  }
}

declare class AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager {
  requestDevice(
    options?: AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager.RequestDeviceOptions
  ): Promise<AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice | undefined>;
}
```

:::note

See [Device filter](./device-filter.mdx) for more information about how does the filter work and how to define a filter.

:::

### `filters`

The `filters` option defaults to `[ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER]`, which matches the ADB interface. If you want to filter devices by vendor ID, product ID, or serial number, you can specify a custom filter array.

`filters` can be `undefined`, but it can't be an empty array. If you want to allow all devices, use `undefined` or `[ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER]`.

### `exclusionFilters`

It's also possible to exclude some devices from the picker by passing an `exclusionFilters` option. It works in reverse: if a device matches any filter in `exclusionFilters`, it will be excluded from the picker.

It can be used to exclude devices that are already paired, or exclude certain devices that's not compatible.

:::info

Support for exclusive filters was added in Chrome 105. It will be ignored in older versions.

### Examples

To select a specific manufacturer and model:


```ts transpile
import {
  AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice,
  ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER,
} from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";

const device: AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice | undefined = await Manager.requestDevice({
  // highlight-start
  filters: [
    {
      ...ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER,
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
      productId: 0x4ee2,
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
});
```

To allow multiple manufacturers/models:

```ts transpile
import {
  AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice,
  ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER,
} from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";

const device: AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice | undefined = await Manager.requestDevice({
  // highlight-start
  filters: [
    {
      ...ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER,
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
      productId: 0x4ee2,
    },
    {
      ...ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER,
      vendorId: 0x04e8,
      productId: 0x6860,
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
});
```

## Drop permission

If a device is connected and the permission to access it was granted, but you don't want to access it anymore, you can drop the permission.

```ts transpile
device.raw.forget();
```

Because there is no way to retrieve permission-granted but disconnected devices (unless you got the `device` before it was disconnected), it's also not possible to drop permissions for them. (See https://github.com/WICG/webusb/issues/166)
