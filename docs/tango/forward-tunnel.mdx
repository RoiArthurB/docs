# Forward tunnel

Forward tunnel allows you to connect to a socket address on the device from Tango.

Unlike in Google ADB CLI, forward tunnel in Tango doesn't require registering the tunnel using a local address, and can be created directly.

```ts
declare class Adb {
  createSocket(address: string): Promise<AdbSocket>;
}
```

## Close socket

The following methods all close the socket:

- `socket.close()`
- `socket.readable.cancel()` (When `readable` is not locked)
- `socket.readable.getReader().cancel()` (When you have the reader)
- `socket.writable.abort()` (When `writable` is not locked)
- `socket.writable.getWriter().abort()` (When you have the writer)
- `socket.writable.close()` (When `writable` is not locked)
- `socket.writable.getWriter().close()` (When you have the writer)

:::info

Not closing a socket will cause a small memory leak, and depends on the other end of the socket, it may not work correctly.

:::

## Example

```ts transpile
import { WritableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const socket = await adb.createSocket("tcp:1234");

await socket.readable.pipeTo(
  new WritableStream({
    write(chunk) {
      console.log(chunk);
    },
  }),
);

await socket.close();
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

It doesn't work in the same way, but you can use the following command to register a forward tunnel and connect to it:

```sh
adb forward tcp:1234 tcp:1234
nc localhost 1234
```
