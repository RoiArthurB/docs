# Quick Start

Tango is a TypeScript re-implementation of ADB ([Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)) client.

:::note

The public API is not stable. Check [GitHub Releases](https://www.github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb/releases) page for changes.

If you have any questions, feel free to open a discussion on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb/discussions) :heart:

## Pre-requisites

Tango runs on both Node.js and Web browsers. It requires the following features:

* [Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API). `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream` and `TransformStream` must be available on `globalThis`. If not, a polyfill like [`web-streams-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-streams-polyfill) can be used.
* BigInt. This can't be polyfilled.
* Promise

Recent versions of Node.js and Web browsers should have all these features.

## Installation

Tango is split into multiple packages to handle different runtimes. First, install the two core packages:

1. [`@yume-chan/adb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/adb): The platform-independent ADB client implementation
2. [`@yume-chan/stream-extra`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/stream-extra): Type definitions and utilities for [Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @yume-chan/adb @yume-chan/stream-extra
```

## Transports

A **Transport** is an interface that provides a way to communicate with ADB daemon running on Android devices. Tango has two built-in transports for common use cases, and also supports custom transports.

### Daemon Transport

    subgraph PC
    CA["JavaScript Client"] <--> Tango
    end
    subgraph Devices
    Tango <-->|USB| A["Device A"]
    Tango <-->|TCP| B["Device B"]
    end
    subgraph PC
    S["Google ADB Server"] x-.-x|USB| A
    O["Other Tango Instance"] x-.-x|USB| A
    end
```

ADB Daemon is a program running on Android devices (when USB Debugging or Wireless Debugging options are enabled) that handles incoming ADB connections and commands.

Daemon Transport connects to ADB daemons directly. This means it can run on devices without Google ADB (not installed, or not available, for example on mobile devices).

It supports three connection methods:

* USB connection: requires a Web browser with WebUSB support (currently, only Chromium-based ones), or Node.js with `usb` package. Note that only one program (or Tango instance) can connect to a device at a time, so it's not compatible with Google ADB server.
* ADB over Wi-Fi: uses TCP sockets, thus not available in Web browsers. In Node.js, it can be implemented using the built-in `net` module. Note that this refers to the old `adb tcpip` mode, not the new Wireless Debugging/`adb pair` mode added in Android 11.

* In addition, Tango also accepts custom connection implementations. For example, a WebSocket connection can forward TCP connections from a Node.js server to a Web browser.

### Server Transport

```mermaid

    subgraph PC
    CA["JavaScript Client A"] <--> TA["Tango Instance A"]
    CB["JavaScript Client B"] <--> TB["Tango Instance B"]
    TA & TB <-->|TCP| S["Google ADB Server"]
    CC["Other Native Client"] <-->|TCP| S
    end
    subgraph Devices
    S <-->|USB| A["Device A"]
    S <-->|TCP| B["Device B"]
    end
```

Google ADB Server is a program running on PC that manages connected devices and allows sharing a device with multiple clients.

Server Transport reimplemented Google ADB Client in TypeScript. It connects to Google ADB server using TCP sockets.

Google ADB Server is traditionally the only way to connect to ADB Daemons, so this transport allows shared access to devices with other programs that use ADB, such as Android Studio.

Because Google ADB Server uses TCP sockets, this transport is only available in Node.js. In Web browsers, a custom connector that converts TCP sockets to Web-compatible transports is required.

### Custom Transport

ADB protocol is a stream multiplexing protocol, where each ADB command is a logical stream, called ADB socket. The goal of both the Daemon Transport and Server Transport is to manage ADB sockets.

Tango also supports custom transports that works directly on ADB socket level. For example, a mock transport can be used in tests, or a WebSocket transport to access devices on a server over the Internet.
