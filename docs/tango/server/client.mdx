# Create client

To get connected devices and connect to them, we need to create a client instance first.

## Create connector

The client requires a server connector to communicate with the Google ADB server. The connector is responsible for sending and receiving packets.

Currently there is no Web API that allows TCP connection. Looking forward to the [Direct Socket API](https://github.com/WICG/direct-sockets).

The [@yume-chan/adb-server-node-tcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/adb-server-node-tcp) package provides a server connector based on Node.js built-in `net` module.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @yume-chan/adb-server-node-tcp
```

Example:

```ts transpile
import { Adb, AdbServerClient, AdbServerDevice } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { AdbServerNodeTcpConnector } from "@yume-chan/adb-server-node-tcp";

const connector: AdbServerNodeTcpConnector = new AdbServerNodeTcpConnector({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5037,
});
```

Because each command creates a new connection, this step only saves the connection information, but does not actually connect to the server.

## Create client

With a server connector, we can create a client:

```ts transpile
import { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const client: AdbServerClient = new AdbServerClient(connector);
```

This step doesn't send or receive any packets, it only initializes some internal states.
