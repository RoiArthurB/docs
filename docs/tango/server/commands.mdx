# Server commands

Google ADB client/server has a separate protocol and a separated command set. Some commands are handled by the server itself, and others operates on a specific device.

## Commands handled by server

### Get version

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  getVersion(): Promise<number>;
}
```

The protocol between ADB client and server has its own version number. This is not Android version (like `13.0`), nor ADB protocol version (like `0x10000001`), nor platform tools version (like `34.0.1`).

This is the version you see in the error message when you use a wrong ADB client to connect to a server:

```text
adb server version (39) doesn't match this client (41); killing...
```

Tango doesn't check the version number, although not thoroughly tested, most of the commands should work on any version of ADB server.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb version
```

If it prints `Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41`, the protocol version is `41`.

:::

### Kill server

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  killServer(): Promise<void>;
}
```

Stops the server.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb kill-server
```

:::

### Get server features

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  getServerFeatures(): Promise<string[]>;
}
```

Gets the ADB features supported by the server. For Google ADB client, the supported feature list is same between client and server, so this reflects how ADB commands will behave.

But in Tango, all ADB commands are generated from Tango, not the ADB client, so this list is not very useful.

Some interesting features:

- `libusb`: The server is using `libusb` to communicate with devices.
- `delayed_ack` The server supports Delayed Acknowledgment for lower latency. Delayed Acknowledgment is a low-level ADB protocol feature, so not controlled by Tango.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb host-features
```

:::

### Get devices

```ts
namespace AdbServerClient {
  interface Device {
    serial: string;
    authenticating: boolean;
    product?: string;
    model?: string;
    device?: string;
    transportId: bigint;
  }
}

declare class AdbServerClient {
  getDevices(): Promise<AdbServerClient.Device[]>;
}
```

Gets all connected devices.

:::note

See [Get devices](./devices.mdx) page for more information about the `getDevices` method.

:::

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb devices -l
```

:::

### Track devices

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  trackDevices(
    signal?: AbortSignal
  ): AsyncGenerator<AdbServerClient.Device[], void, void>;
}
```

Get notified when a device is connected or disconnected.

:::note

See [Watch devices](./watch.mdx) page for more information about the `trackDevices` method.

:::

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

There is no equivalent ADB command.

:::

## Commands that operates device

### Device selector

All commands that operates on a device requires a `DeviceSelector` object to specify the target device.

:::note

See [Device selector](./selector.mdx) page for more information about `DeviceSelector`.

:::

### Get device features

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  getDeviceFeatures(
    selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector
  ): Promise<{ transportId: bigint; features: AdbFeature[] }>;
}
```

Gets the ADB features supported by the device. It's required for Tango to coordinate the behavior of ADB commands with the device.

For example, if [Shell protocol](../../api/subprocess.mdx#none-protocol-vs-shell-protocol) is not supported by the device, using `AdbSubprocessShellProtocol` will immediately throw an error.

Usually you don't need to call this method directly, the `AdbServerClient#createTransport` method uses it to create a `AdbTransport` object.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb features
```

:::

### Create device socket

```ts
namespace AdbServerClient {
  interface Socket extends AdbSocket {
    transportId: bigint;
  }
}

declare class AdbServerClient {
  createDeviceConnection(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector,
    service: string
  ): Promise<AdbServerClient.Socket>;
}
```

Creates a socket to the ADB daemon on the device, letting the server forward packets between the client and the device.

The socket can be used to run an ADB command, or connect to a socket on device.

Usually you don't need to call this method directly, the `AdbServerClient#createTransport` method uses it to implement `AdbTransport`.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

There is no equivalent ADB command.

:::

### Wait for device

```ts
interface AdbServerConnectionOptions {
  unref?: boolean | undefined;
  signal?: AbortSignal | undefined;
}

declare class AdbServerClient {
  waitFor(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector,
    state: "device" | "disconnect",
    options?: AdbServerConnectionOptions
  ): Promise<void>;
}
```

Wait for a device to be connected or disconnected. This method returns a `Promise` that resolves when the condition is met.

If the selector is `usb`, `tcp` or `undefined`, it won't tell which device is connected or disconnected.

Options:

- `unref`: If the underlying connection is using Node.js `net` module, then `unref` the socket so the process can exit even if the connection is still alive.
- `signal`: Stops the wait when the signal is aborted.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb wait-for[-TRANSPORT]-STATE
```

For example:

```sh
adb wait-for-device
adb wait-for-usb-device
adb wait-for-disconnect
adb wait-for-usb-disconnect
```

:::

### Create transport

```ts
declare class AdbServerTransport implements AdbTransport {}

declare class AdbServerClient {
  createTransport(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector
  ): Promise<AdbServerTransport>;
}
```

Creates an `AdbTransport` object for the device. It's not one server command, it uses multiple server commands internally to implement the transport.

The returned transport object can be used to construct an `Adb` instance:

```ts transpile
import { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const transport: AdbServerTransport = await client.createTransport({
  transportId: 123n,
});
const adb: Adb = new Adb(transport);
```
