As mentioned in [Create USB connection](../daemon/usb/create-connection.mdx), a USB device can only be exclusively accessed by one process at a time. This means if multiple ADB clients are trying to connect to the same device, only one of them will succeed.

Google ADB solves this problem by starting a server (also called "host") to manage the USB devices, and all ADB clients connect to the server instead of the device directly. The server will forward the packets from clients to the device, and forward the packets from the device to the clients.

The protocol between ADB client and server is different from the protocol between ADB server and device (daemon). Tango provides a client implementation for the client-server protocol, but since the server usually listens on a TCP port, Tango requires a server connector object to handle the data communication.

Here are the overall steps to create a server connection:

```mermaid

    participant C as Client
    participant A as AdbServerClient

    create participant Conn as AdbServerClient.ServerConnector
    C->>Conn: Create

    participant G as ADB Server
    participant D as Device

    C->>+A: Get device list
    A->>A: Create server command
    A->>+Conn: Send command
    Conn->>+G: Forward command

    G->>-Conn: Return response
    Conn->>-A: Forward response
    A->>A: Parse response
    A->>-C: Return device list

    C->>+A: Connect to device
    A->>A: Create server command
    A->>+Conn: Send command
    Conn->>+G: Forward command
    G->>G: Create device command
    G->>+D: Send command
    D->>-G: Return response
    G->>G: Parse response
    G->>-Conn: Return response
    Conn->>-A: Forward response
    A->>A: Parse response
    A->>-C: Return device instance
```
