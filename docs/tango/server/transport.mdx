# Create transport

The `AdbServerClient#createTransport` method creates an `AdbTransport` for the specified device. The device must have already been authenticated.

The target device can be selected using a `DeviceSelector` object.

:::note

See [Device selector](./selector.mdx) page for how to create a selector.

:::

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  createTransport(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector
  ): Promise<AdbTransport>;
}
```

This process is asynchronous, because `AdbServerClient` needs to fetch some extra information about the device from ADB Server.

The returned `AdbTransport` object can be used to create an `Adb` instance.

```ts transpile
import { Adb, AdbTransport } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const transport: AdbTransport = await client.createTransport(device);
const adb: Adb = new Adb(transport);
```
